Description: Isimbi is a naturally processed blend intended to offer a clean and consistent cup profile year after year by sourcing from various smallholder farmers who produce specialty quality Rwandan coffees. Named the Kinyarwandan word for the white at the top of a volcano, Isimbi is used to refer to something pure. Isimbi is put together by a group who works intimately throughout the whole harvest season in Rwanda which means not only that producers get fair prices for their coffee, but also makes it easier for the cup profile to hit itâ€™s target each year. This lot contributes to in country programs focusing on farmer training of good agricultural practices.

Upon arrival, we thought this was a unique tasting natural from Africa. It was low in acid and high in sweetness. With notes of ripe grape and blackberry, and a linger like cacao nibs.
