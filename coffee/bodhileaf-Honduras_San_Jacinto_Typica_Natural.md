Description: Isaura Martínez has dedicated her life to the cultivation of coffee. Learning from her father, Antonio Martínez, the good practices of processing, drying and storage of coffee. Her father is a legend in Opatoro, La Paz, and a visionary farmer.

With the arrival of Roya in Honduras in 2012, Isaura Martínez lost more than 60% of her production which added to the crisis of bad prices offered by the intermediaries. In 2014, with the help and friendship of siblings Karen and Edgar Carrillo, work began on the separation of coffee according to quality improvements were made to coffee collection and the milling process.

The 2015-2016 harvest had substantially improved cup quality in the washed process. Further improvement was made during 2016-2017 harvest and the coffee was processed using the natural method for the first time with good results. Bodhi Leaf is proud to have supported Isaura Martinez by purchasing this great coffee from Finca San Jacinto for over 4 years! 

The farm’s name of “San Jacinto” was chosen due to the Hyacinth flower that is naturally found on the land.
