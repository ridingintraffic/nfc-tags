When Anxi County is mentioned, often the first thought to come is of Anxi tieguanyin, “Iron Goddess” tea. It is well-known both at home and abroad as one of China’s top 10 teas. This particular type of Anxi tieguanyin, Ma Liu Mie ‘Monkey King’ belongs to the zhengchao type of tieguanyin, with a comfortably brisk and smooth flavor.

When it comes to this tea’s name, legend has it that the cliffs where this tea are too steep for people to pick the tea leaves, so monkeys are trained to climb the cliffs and pick the tea for the farmers. Another legend tells that farmers must tie a rope around their waist during picking so they can climb the cliffs and trees much like monkeys.
