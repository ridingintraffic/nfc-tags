To make this tea, natural strawberry extractives are added following the preparation of the oolong leaves, in order to retain the original flavor as well as ensure that both this and the strawberry fragrance can be tasted. The leaves themselves are picked and produced under traditional methods.

As soon as you open the bag you can smell the sweet strawberry fragrance, which comes out even more strongly during brewing.
