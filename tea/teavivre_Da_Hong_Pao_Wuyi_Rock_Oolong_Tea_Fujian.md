Wuyi oolong tea, also known as ‘rock oolong’ or “yancha”, is produced in northern Fujian. The tea leaves in this family are long and curly rather than ball-shaped, and are more oxidized and more heavier roasted than their southern cousin of Tie Guan Yin. Wuyi tea is not a single tea variety; rather, it refers to all teas that are grown on Wuyi Mountain.
