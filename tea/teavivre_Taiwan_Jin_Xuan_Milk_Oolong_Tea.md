TeaVivre’s Jin Xuan is another type of classic Taiwan oolong, belonging to a category of tea often termed milk oolong for its sweet, creamy taste. However, this particular Jin Xuan is special and unique in that its milky aroma and flavor are entirely natural, with no added flavoring like in some other teas.

The first three infusions of this tea will start to bring out a slightly milky scent, which gradually fades away in later cups. While steeping, the loosely-balled leaves unfurl to yield a highly aromatic, smooth, mellow infusion, light-bodied with sweet cream and floral notes. The creaminess is a characteristic of the leaves’ variety, where they are grown, and the processing methods; again, there are no flavors added to this tea.
