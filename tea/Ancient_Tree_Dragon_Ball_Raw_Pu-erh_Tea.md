This ancient tree raw pu-erh dragon ball was produced from tea leaves picked early Spring 2016, from trees older than 300 years, in the high mountains. This tea follows the “one bud, one or two leaves” picking standard.

As the Chinese saying goes, “the early spring tea is as precious as gold”. Early spring tea is also called “Ming qian” tea, and it has a rich fragrance and abundant inclusions, meaning that this tea retains a lingering aroma through brewing. Its dry leaves are covered with dense pekoe; enthusiasts for ancient tree tea can smell the characteristic aroma of the trees’ age on these leaves. Compared with normal large-leaf tea tree species, the tea from these trees has a more complex taste, with a slight bitterness up-front that immediately disappears and turns to a stronger, sweeter aftertaste; the age of the trees also lends a slight floral aroma to the tea.

The recommended brewing method of this raw dragon ball pu-erh is to use teacups, brewing for six minutes, so that its taste is the best and sweetness is prominent.
