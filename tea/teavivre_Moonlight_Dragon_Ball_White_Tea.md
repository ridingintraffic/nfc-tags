Yue Guang Bai, also known as Moonlight Beauty, is a special type of pu-erh. This tea is made through the same processes of Fuding white tea, which is why it is also considered a white tea. This tea is made entirely from ancient trees in Jinggu, one of the largest growing areas in Pu’er City known for its high-quality white tea; as a result, the fresh leaves are rich in nutrients and have a strong fragrance when dry and a rich, remarkable taste when brewed that lasts through many infusions.

This tea is made with material from the Jinggu Dabai variety of tea push, with the plucking standard of one leaf to one bud. It is entirely handmade, and each dragon ball is individually wrapped in white paper that serves well for collection, storage, and transportation. When brewed this tea gives a crystal-clear and bright liquid, with a light honey fragrance accompanied by a hint of an aroma of dried dates.
